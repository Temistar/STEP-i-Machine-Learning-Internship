The process I took to complete the task was to

Understand the data using different EDA methods
Feature Engeneering and to especially Transform categorical variables to the numerical variables
Also also Scaled the data using standardization
Then I applied a linear regression to predict the CTC
Evaluate the results of the analysis

The data files are provided in the Task 2 GitHub Folder

Data_file.xlsx

Data_file is a dataset that I used to train my model.

Test Data files:

Test_data_file.xlsx

Test_Data_file is a dataset that I used to test my model and find out the Mean Square Value.
